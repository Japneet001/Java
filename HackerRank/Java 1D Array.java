/* 
* An array is a simple data structure used to store a collection of data in a contiguous block of memory. Each element in the collection is accessed using an index, and the elements are easy to find because they're stored sequentially in memory.
* Because the collection of elements in an array is stored as a big block of data, we typically use arrays when we know exactly how many pieces of data we're going to have. For example, you might use an array to store a list of student ID numbers, or the names of state capitals. To create an array of integers named  that can hold four integer values, you would write the following code:

* int[] myArray = new int[4];
* This sets aside a block of memory that's capable of storing  integers. Each integer storage cell is assigned a unique index ranging from  to one less than the size of the array, and each cell initially contains a . In the case of , we can store integers at indices , , , and . Let's say we wanted the last cell to store the number ; to do this, we write:

* myArray[3] = 12;
* Similarly, we can print the contents of the last cell with the following code:

* System.out.println(myArray[3]);
* The code above prints the value stored at index  of , which is  (the value we previously stored there). It's important to note that while Java initializes each cell of an array of integers with a , not all languages do this.

* Task
* The code in your editor does the following:

* Reads an integer from stdin and saves it to a variable, , denoting some number of integers.
* Reads  integers corresponding to  from stdin and saves each integer  to a variable, .
* Attempts to print each element of an array of integers named .
* Write the following code in the unlocked portion of your editor:

* Create an array, , capable of holding  integers.
* Modify the code in the loop so that it saves each sequential value to its corresponding location in the array. For example, the first value must be stored in , the second value must be stored in , and so on.
* Good luck!

* Input Format

* The first line contains a single integer, , denoting the size of the array.
* Each line  of the  subsequent lines contains a single integer denoting the value of element .

* Output Format

* You are not responsible for printing any output to stdout. Locked code in the editor loops through array  and prints each sequential element on a new line. */
